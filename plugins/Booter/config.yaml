            It was the best of times, it was the worst of times,
            it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness,
            it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity,
            it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness,
            it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair,
            we had everything before us, we had nothing before us,
            we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct
            the other way--in short, the period was so far like the present
            period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its
            being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree
            of comparison only.
            
            There were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face,
            on the throne of England; there were a king with a large jaw and
            a queen with a fair face, on the throne of France.  In both
            countries it was clearer than crystal to the lords of the State
            preserves of loaves and fishes, that things in general were
            settled for ever.
            
            It was the year of Our Lord one thousand seven hundred and
            seventy-five.  Spiritual revelations were conceded to England at
            that favoured period, as at this.  Mrs. Southcott had recently
            attained her five-and-twentieth blessed birthday, of whom a
            prophetic private in the Life Guards had heralded the sublime
            appearance by announcing that arrangements were made for the
            swallowing up of London and Westminster.  Even the Cock-lane
            ghost had been laid only a round dozen of years, after rapping
            out its messages, as the spirits of this very year last past
            (supernaturally deficient in originality) rapped out theirs.
            Mere messages in the earthly order of events had lately come to
            the English Crown and People, from a congress of British subjects
            in America:  which, strange to relate, have proved more important
            to the human race than any communications yet received through
            any of the chickens of the Cock-lane brood.
            
            France, less favoured on the whole as to matters spiritual than
            her sister of the shield and trident, rolled with exceeding
            smoothness down hill, making paper money and spending it.
            Under the guidance of her Christian pastors, she entertained
            herself, besides, with such humane achievements as sentencing
            a youth to have his hands cut off, his tongue torn out with
            pincers, and his body burned alive, because he had not kneeled
            down in the rain to do honour to a dirty procession of monks
            which passed within his view, at a distance of some fifty or
            sixty yards.  It is likely enough that, rooted in the woods of
            France and Norway, there were growing trees, when that sufferer
            was put to death, already marked by the Woodman, Fate, to come
            down and be sawn into boards, to make a certain movable framework
            with a sack and a knife in it, terrible in history.  It is likely
            enough that in the rough outhouses of some tillers of the heavy
            lands adjacent to Paris, there were sheltered from the weather
            that very day, rude carts, bespattered with rustic mire, snuffed
            about by pigs, and roosted in by poultry, which the Farmer, Death,
            had already set apart to be his tumbrils of the Revolution.
            But that Woodman and that Farmer, though they work unceasingly,
            work silently, and no one heard them as they went about with
            muffled tread:  the rather, forasmuch as to entertain any suspicion
            that they were awake, was to be atheistical and traitorous.
            
            In England, there was scarcely an amount of order and protection
            to justify much national boasting.  Daring burglaries by armed
            men, and highway robberies, took place in the capital itself
            every night; families were publicly cautioned not to go out of
            town without removing their furniture to upholsterers' warehouses
            for security; the highwayman in the dark was a City tradesman in
            the light, and, being recognised and challenged by his fellow-
            tradesman whom he stopped in his character of the Captain,
            gallantly shot him through the head and rode away; the mail was
            waylaid by seven robbers, and the guard shot three dead, and then
            got shot dead himself by the other four, in consequence of the
            failure of his ammunition: after which the mail was robbed in
            peace; that magnificent potentate, the Lord Mayor of London, was
            made to stand and deliver on Turnham Green, by one highwayman,
            who despoiled the illustrious creature in sight of all his
            retinue; prisoners in London gaols fought battles with their
            turnkeys, and the majesty of the law fired blunderbusses in among
            them, loaded with rounds of shot and ball; thieves snipped off
            diamond crosses from the necks of noble lords at Court
            drawing-rooms; musketeers went into St. Giles's, to search for
            contraband goods, and the mob fired on the musketeers, and the
            musketeers fired on the mob, and nobody thought any of these
            occurrences much out of the common way.  In the midst of them,
            the hangman, ever busy and ever worse than useless, was in
            constant requisition; now, stringing up long rows of miscellaneous
            criminals; now, hanging a housebreaker on Saturday who had been
            taken on Tuesday; now, burning people in the hand at Newgate by
            the dozen, and now burning pamphlets at the door of Westminster Hall;
            to-day, taking the life of an atrocious murderer, and to-morrow of a
            wretched pilferer who had robbed a farmer's boy of sixpence.
            
            All these things, and a thousand like them, came to pass in
            and close upon the dear old year one thousand seven hundred
            and seventy-five.  Environed by them, while the Woodman and the
            Farmer worked unheeded, those two of the large jaws, and those
            other two of the plain and the fair faces, trod with stir enough,
            and carried their divine rights with a high hand.  Thus did the
            year one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five conduct their
            Greatnesses, and myriads of small creatures--the creatures of this
            chronicle among the rest--along the roads that lay before them.
            
            I see that child who lay upon her bosom and who bore my name, a man
            winning his way up in that path of life which once was mine.  I see
            him winning it so well, that my name is made illustrious there by the
            light of his.  I see the blots I threw upon it, faded away.  I see
            him, fore-most of just judges and honoured men, bringing a boy of my
            name, with a forehead that I know and golden hair, to this place--
            then fair to look upon, with not a trace of this day's disfigurement
            --and I hear him tell the child my story, with a tender and a faltering
            voice.
            
            It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done;
            it is a far, far better rest that I go to than I have ever known. Dotcom.
